title: "Single Uniprior Index Coding With Min–Max Probability of Error Over Fading Channels"
collection: publications
category: Journals
excerpt: 'In this paper, we consider unicast index coding problems and present results on the number of optimal length index codes making use of the representation of an index coding problem by an equivalent network code. Our formulation results in matrices of smaller sizes compared to the approach of Koetter and Medard (R. Koetter and M. Medard, “An algebraic approach to network coding,” IEEE/ACM Trans. Netw., vol. 11, no. 5, pp. 782-795, Oct. 2003.)'
