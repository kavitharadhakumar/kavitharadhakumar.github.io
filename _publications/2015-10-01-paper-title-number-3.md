title: "Single Uniprior Index Coding With Min–Max Probability of Error Over Fading Channels"
collection: publications
category: Journals
excerpt: 'An index coding scheme in which the source (transmitter) transmits symbols over a wireless fading channel is considered. Index codes with the transmitter using minimum number of transmissions are known as optimal index codes. Different optimal index codes give different performances in terms of probability of error in a fading environment, and this also varies from receiver to receiver. In this paper, we deal with optimal index codes, which minimizes the maximum probability of error among all the receivers. We identify a criterion for optimal index codes that minimizes the maximum probability of error among all the receivers.'
