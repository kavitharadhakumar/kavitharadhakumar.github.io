## About Me

I am a Machine Learning & AI Engineer with over 10 years of professional experience, building data-driven systems that progress from research and experimentation to production-ready, scalable solutions.

My career began in wireless and telecom system engineering, where I worked on PHY-layer algorithms, signal processing, and performance optimization for large-scale communication systems. In these roles, I applied early machine learning techniques to problems such as modem performance tuning, interference detection, anomaly analysis, and parameter prediction—experiences that shaped a strong systems-oriented engineering mindset.

Over time, this foundation evolved into a broader focus on applied machine learning, deep learning, and AI engineering, with an emphasis on robust model development, rigorous performance evaluation, and real-world deployment constraints. I enjoy solving ambiguous problems and translating them into measurable, scalable ML solutions, bridging theoretical models with practical, production-grade AI systems.
